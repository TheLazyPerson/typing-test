# Introduction

Typing test allows users to test there typing speed and accuracy. The application provides following features:

- User can create a new test with ability to choose level of difficulty between Easy, Medium, Hard and check based on typing speed.
- Based on the mistakes and typing speed show users there score
- Test lasts for certain amount of time.
- Calculating the score in a way that every word that is correct gets 10 points and misspelling reduces 5 points.

## Milestones

1. Create a functional typing experience with ability to stop the clock and calculate the score.
2. Handle edge cases.
3. Add ability to have difficulty levels for the tests.
4. Add ability to have highlighted words and text field below for easy and medium tests.
5. Updating any additional asthetics.

# Development

## General Guidelines

- Try to seperate concerns
- Try to increase test coverage
- Follow naming conventions
- Start quick and dirty and work your way to refactored solution

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

# Testing

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
